## Introdiction

This script generates the Fibonacci sequence up until the users' specifcation of how big it wants the file to be. 
It also has other functionality such as whether the user wants each term numbered or an additional newline to sperate the terms in the text file

## Help

This script is simple. Runs in native Python without any dependencies. You can just download it and run it as normal. 

## Roadmap

- [ ] Rework as CLI. Replace top variables with command line arguments.
